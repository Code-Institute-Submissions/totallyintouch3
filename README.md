Hello and welcome to my 'Readme', the Readme will give you lot's of information 
about the website that I have constructed.

The website has been constructed for 'Totally Intouch Ltd' which is a ltd company 
that I own and needs a website, so what better opportunity for me to construct a
free site.

Totally Intouch Ltd is a technology company and specializes in the supply and install
of the latest tech as listed below.

NEST
Home Automation
Home Gadgets
Smart Utilities
CCTV
Audio Visual

I have constructed the website using Bootstrap 3 and have done corrections using CSS.

The file structure is compiled with one main folder called 'totallyintouch' which
contains sub folders as listed below.

git
assets
Wire Frames

and the Html files as listed below.

home_automation

smart_utilities

The 'assets' subfolder contains folders as listed below.

smart_utilities images

The 'Wire Frames' subfolder contains the wireframes that were prepared to the Client's specification.

The wire frames were prepared using 'Autocad' which I am familiar with, I know that there are wire frame applications 
available but 'Autocad' does a pretty good job too.

The website has been constructed using a 'Navbar' at the top of the page and a 'footer' at the bottom.
The main body and 'content area' has images and information using the 3 3 3 3 bootstrap container.

The 'navbar' has seven link pages that navigate to eight different pages meaning that the page that you are on 
does not appear in the 'navbar'.

The 'navbar' also has a 'Dropdown Menu'form which when clicked upon will present the user with Social links....
when clicked upon will open a new tab window and direct the user to the relevant social link.Also from this menu you click on 
'Download Brochure' and find out more about 'Totally Intouch Ltd', the Brochure will open in a new tab window in pdf format
so it can be downloaded or printed.
Below this option we have 'How to find Us' which when clicked upon will open a new tab window and direct the user to 'Totally Intouch Ltd' address 
shown on Google Maps with directions on how to 'Totally Intouch Ltd'.

When the website is shown on mobile devices with a maximum width of 980 pixels the navbar will collapse into a three bar
'Hamburger' type navigation bar which when clicked upon will open and display the navigation menu as a drop down list on 
the lefthand side of the display with the 'Contact Us' button being displayed in the middle bottom of the menu.

The 'navbar' also has a 'Contact Us' Modal form which when clicked upon will present the user with a form so they
can enter their 'name, email, project and information about their project'.

The 'Home page' has a Carousel displaying images from the Client's brochure and three text areas explaining what the Client offers and their background
information.

The 'content area' has four images and descriptions and can be enlarged when clicked upon.
In the image description the 'Client' wanted the prices highlighted so this was acchieved with the <mark> code.

To get over the problem I had with black text flowing over dark images and not displaying very clear or readable
I placed the text upon a <p class="bg-primary"> to highlist and make it readable.

The 'footer' has been left basic only with the 'Client's Company Copyright'.

I hope I have covered everything, if not please give feedback on jfsystemsuk@yahoo.co.uk

Regards  James (snake coding).
